  <h6>You should've paid more attention in school! Do not show your mom this score, HIDE!</h6>

    <h6>I mean you got a couple correct. But I would do some studying next time,
      before you embarass yourself like this again!</h6>

  <div id="threeOutOfTen">
    <h6>If this was for a grade in your history class, you would've failed and have had to retake the class!</h6>

    <h6>Congratulations! You scored 10/10! You are the Ultimate Trivia Master! You can now officially use this score on any college or job resume,
